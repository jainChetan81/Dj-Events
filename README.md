# DJ Events Using NextJs and Strapi CMS

In this project, the power of CMS is used to create or update any event that the project might require, User can add a picture as well to ensure that events are distinguishable
Role based access is also granted in this application to ensure that no one can just edit or delete any event which can be done via CMS or the frontend itself

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, ContextAPI, MomentJS, CSS Modules, query-string, react-toastify

**Server:** StrapiCMS, slugify

**ContextAPI**- for State managment\
**moment** - for time manipulation\
**css modules** - so css classes won't mixup and names can be reused\
**qs** - for retreiving names from query\
**react-toastify** - for snackbar\
**slugify** - for converting names to slug

## Lessons Learned

- I started this project to learn about nextjs and have a little more knowledge of Strapi CMS.
- NextJS is a framework based on react that enables us to create server side rendering application or static pages or hybrid app like this one
- There are mainly two type of Applications develped by Next :- \
    **Static Generation (Recommended)**: The HTML is generated at build time and will be reused on each request. \
    **Server-side Rendering**: The HTML is generated on each request.\

- Since Next is based on React, the whole concept of React is applied here from components to states or props, except for routing which is provided by Next
- The main difference in Next vs CRA is 3 different functions which can be declared in components
- **getStaticProps** - If you have external data fetch that data in ths function. This function gets called at build time and lets you pass fetched data to the page's props on pre-render.
- **getServerSideProps** - The HTML is generated on each request. Because Server-side Rendering results in slower performance than Static Generation, use this only if absolutely necessary.
- **getStaticPaths** - uses dynamic routes, Next.js will statically pre-render all the paths specified
- *jsconfig.js* - used it to add Paths like ``  ["components/*"], `` to automatically guide to components whenever needed
- *next.config.js* - added ``res.cloudinary.com`` to image domains
- *contextApi* - started learning about vital contextAPI , with the introduction of hooks its easier this time by creating a different folder of context
- **useEffect** - lifecycle that runs every time there is a change

## Documentation

- Layout.js was created to create a Layout for every page where a title and description can be added
- In the index.js which is mai page I am statically fetching 3 events to show and a button for "/events" where all events can be shown
- There is a 404.js page which points to unfound URL
- in events api there is an extension [slug] which takes to page of details about a certain event where two edit and delete buttons are
- In delete button it sends a DELETE request to api with slug to delete the event
- In search page we take the query and search it to every event available and searches through every name, description, performer and venue using ``qs`` library
- In edit section there is a image upload component which takes the image and upload it to the form via formData()
- to use this a Modal had to be created for which we added a modal that can be used by anyone around and to do that we had to create a _document.js where a simple id was added to access the modal
- that id was accesse using ``ReactDOM.createPortal(<modal_Content>, document.getElementById("modal-id"));``
